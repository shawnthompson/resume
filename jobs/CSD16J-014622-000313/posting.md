It is your responsibility as a candidate to submit a cover letter, which clearly outlines how you meet each of the screening qualifications (i.e. Education and Experience Qualifications, both Essential and Assets experiences) as well as a CV which is linked to the information in your cover letter. Please note that it is not sufficient to only state that you meet the qualifications or to provide a listing of current or past task description. 

Rather you must provide concrete examples, which illustrate how you meet each qualification. One suitable approach is to use each screening qualification as a heading, and provide a detailed description how that qualification is met. Failure to provide an appropriate cover letter may result in your application being rejected from the process. Candidates must clearly indicate the length of their work experiences, by providing detailed information.

We therefore encourage women (especially in non-traditional occupations), Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minority groups to apply and declare themselves as part of one or more of the above mentioned Employment Equity Designated Groups.

Acknowledgment of receipt of applications will not be sent; we will contact candidates when the screening process is completed.

Please identify clearly your substantive group and level and your employment status on your resume and/or application form.

Please ensure that your Personal Record Identifier (PRI) is included in your application.

You must provide proof of your education credentials.

In the case of an acting appointment, the Public Service Employment Regulations enables the organization to exclude the appointee from respecting official language proficiency when the department is unable to fill the position with an appointment of a person who meets the language proficiency qualification. Therefore, we would encourage all to apply, in the event the organization is unable to fill the position with an appointment of a person who meets the language proficiency, others may be considered.

We strongly encourage applicants to submit their applications on-line.

Following are some of the benefits associated with applying on-line:
• Applicants can create and manage their accounts and apply to job opportunities as long as an internet connection is available.
• Applicants can create a profile and retrieve stored application(s) (personal information, covering letter and résumé) previously submitted and modify them, if necessary, before submitting the application.
• Applicants can modify their application/resume at anytime BEFORE the closing date indicated on the job advertisement.

The Public Service of Canada is committed to building a skilled, diverse workforce reflective of Canadian society. As a result, it promotes employment equity and encourages candidates to indicate voluntarily on their application if they are a woman, an Aboriginal person, a person with a disability or a member of a visible minority group.

The Public Service of Canada is also committed to developing inclusive, barrier-free selection processes and work environments. If contacted in relation to a job opportunity or testing, you should advise the Public Service Commission or the departmental official in a timely fashion of the accommodation measures which must be taken to enable you to be assessed in a fair and equitable manner.
