## Experience

### Experience analyzing business/client requirements.

Working on creating technical specification documents for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) components for Canada.ca from requirements sent to me from the Adobe Business Analysis team. This job involves evaluating the client’s needs and determination the best approach in creating a document for the developers to build the component to specifications. This process includes scrum meeting twice a week to ensure the application developer has all they need before they start development.

In my current position I create technical web components specification for the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) Content and Information Architecture Specifications document based on business needs of the clients.

As part of the Principle Publisher team for the Web Renewal Initiative, I often get request from other on boarding departments to create new components for the Canada.ca website and I have to analyze if what the client is asking is either already possible, needs modification of something that is present or needs to be developed from scratch.

When I was part of the Service Canada internet publishing team, one of my main responsibilities was to take request from clients, analyze their needs and triage it to a colleague who was best suited for the task. Once the employee was finished the job, I would have to review their work and give feedback before sending it back to the client for final review.

### Experience providing advice, options and recommendations in the definition, development and implementation of IM/IT solutions.

I work closely with Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) when developing the template pages for the Canada.ca theme in the Web Experience Toolkit (WET), often making recommendations to change their Content and Information Architecture Specification to better fit the website. We have weekly meetings to discuss changes to the Specification, trying to predict any conflicts when building the HTML versions of the required templates.

In Montreal, I sit near IT developers which I often provide assistance to these developers with front end Web Experience Toolkit (WET) support with how too use the WET framework with their web applications. I have also held weekly WET codesprints in my office and invited them to join. 

I support the Content Delivery Network (CDN) solution for the Government of Canada (GoC) activities and initiatives that are found on all the GoC websites. If something goes wrong with the application for the users, I get calls off hours and help trouble shoot what went wrong with the change they made. There is not much documentation on how this application works so I often have to figure out how it works and how it can be fixed.  

### Experience in providing support to IM/IT activities/projects for multiple clients, appropriately prioritizing workload and meeting deadlines in a multi-tasking environment.

Presently have multiple projects that are my responsibility. Project range from high priority, request from the Privy Council Office, to low priority, the Web Experience Toolkit maintenance. Every day I evaluate my workload and prioritize my daily tasks. I organize my tasks in priority order, always warranting making room for low priority tasks. Below are some of my current projects.

#### GCWeb theme 

Develop and maintain GCWeb theme for the Government of Canada's Web Experience Toolkit (WET) project on GitHub.com. This involves analyzing the templates in the Content and Information Architecture (IA) Specification written by TBS and turning them into HTML version of the layout defined in the document. The document is constantly changing, which means I need to assess which templates are being used on the site and what changes need to be prioritized. 

#### Web Experience Toolkit (WET)

Service Canada took over the responsibility from TBS for the WET project. My responsibilities with this project are to analyze the open issues on Github, fix the issue and if I cannot, find someone in the WET community who can. Lately I have been trying to grow the contributors of the community by holding weekly learning sessions over WebEx on different subject related to WET. Some of these subject include, "Building WET", “How to use Github” and “Tips and tricks”.

#### Request from the Privy Council Office (PCO)

These requests are treated as high priority and need to be deal with as soon as they come in. The requests range from 

* adding code to the WET framework for a need for one of PCO’s webpages in AEM
* updating a WET plugin to support a feature they want to add to the site
* mockup an HTML page layout with the WET framework that they supply us for a promotional page on Canada.ca

#### Adobe Experience Manager on boarding

Create technical specification for the web components that the on boarding sites are using based on business needs of the departments. Two examples of these components are the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) details / summary polyfill and the WET Calendar of Events plugin. Because all components are being built in different deployment sprints, I need to prioritize writing the different components specification depending on what sprint it is in. 

### Experience evaluating static and dynamic web based systems against Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) Web Standards.

I was part of the HRSDC (now ESDC) Web Standards Subject Matter Expert (SME) group where I was responsible for the review of web content and/or web application output for a specific groups within Service Canada and verify that they were complying with Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) Web Standards.

I was also part of a team that audited pages on ServiceCanada.gc.ca to ensure they comply with the TBS standards on Accessibility, Interoperability and Mobility.

I worked on coding individual web pages for the Service Canada internet, and provided clients with advice on the best way to present their material while maintaining the TBS standards for the Web. I was also involved in creating training materials for clients and training them on the best ways to produce web content. I learned that helping people to understand the needs of the web and my team allowed for much better communication of ideas and cooperation between the various Service Canada businesses

### Experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I built the template pages for the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) Canada.ca theme from the requirements set by the Content and Information Architecture Specification using HTML and CSS for the layout, while using Javascript for any functional needs. I have been using HTML, CSS and Javascript on a daily basis for the 10 years as a member of web publishing and design teams in the Government of Canada. I regularly attend workshops, codesprints and take courses to ensure that my knowledge and experience with this software is current.

## Knowledge

### Knowledge of TBS Web Standards (Accessibility, Usability, Interoperability, Mobile and Search).

On a daily basis, I need to ensure the web pages I create follow all of Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) web standards. I am also member of the Web Interoperability working group / HTML Data sub-committee, Search Optimization Working Group (SOWG) and User Experience Working Group. I have used these standards on a daily basis for the last 8 years as a web coder, member of the principal publishing group and web development team. I make sure that my understanding of the standards is up to date by my involvement in working groups and by taking additional training when it is available or required.

### Knowledge of TBS Web Standards testing and evaluation methodologies.

As part of the HRSDC Web Standards Subject Matter Expert (SME) group it was my role to test the web content using TBS testing and evaluation methodologies, filling out a report and send it back to those who were responsible for the web content / application. I helped develop a check-list that my clients were able to use, based upon the TBS Web standards and I worked closely with the publishing Quality Assurance (QA) team to help ensure that all completed material was consistent and compliant.

### Basic knowledge of .NET, JAVA, CSS, HTML, XML, AJAX, jQuery.

My present daily responsibility involves working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I received basic training in Java and AJAX and have basic knowledge in .net and XML. Some of the course I have taken on these subjects are listed below.

## Abilities

### Ability to communicate effectively orally.

I have given seminars at 2 Codefests and provided training sessions for colleagues and clients on various subjects including "How to create content for the web" and “How to use the Web Experience Toolkit”. I enjoy meeting and conversing with people from different backgrounds and cultures and sharing ideas.

In 2014, I gave a talk at the a11yMTL Unconference on the subject of using semantic HTML elements to mark up a web page for accessibility. 

I am an active member in the following groups and committees: 

* Web Interoperability working group / HTML Data sub-committee
* Search Optimization Working Group (SOWG) 
* User experience working group
* Migration and onboarding working group
* Adobe AEM/CQ User Group - Montreal Chapter
* HTML5 Montréal
* a11yMTL - Montreal Web Accessibility

### Ability to communicate effectively in writing.

Due to my working remotely in Montreal a large portion of my job is done via email. I often need to communicate via email to clients, colleagues and others in the Government of Canada web community. I am comfortable and skilled in written communications and am able to tailor my messages to suit my intended audience. My experience in creating training materials for various groups has helped me in this area.

The technical specifications documents I write for the Adobe Experience Manager developers have broadened my written skills to include technical writing which involves logical and analytical 

### Ability to establish priorities and meeting deadlines.

Dealing with high profile clients like PCO, Adobe and TBS on a daily basis I often have to deal with conflicting deadlines and priorities. I often have to negotiate with clients to schedule different releases of products. I am adept at working with others in order to ensure that my tasks and completed in a timely manner. I am able to work on many projects simultaneously and meet my targets.

## Competencies

### Analytical thinking.

The Web Experience Toolkit (WET) recently became Service Canada's responsibility and without much knowledge on how the system worked, I had to think analytically on ways to keep the system working flawlessly with the little knowledge I already had about the system.

Often when prioritizing tasks I use analytical thinking to determine how much time it will take to accomplish a task, any efficient solutions and fit them into my daily schedule. I start the morning by organizing my tasks by priority, time it will take and if I can get a colleague to help with any of my tasks.  

Because of my analytical thinking, colleagues always come to me to help problem solve their WET issues.

## Personal Suitability

### Client focus.

I excel in customer service and client interaction. I am known by colleagues and clients as someone who is approachable and will take the time to listen to concerns and issues regarding our work, and seek to find solutions that will meet or exceed their needs. I have participated in events such as Codefest and Gtec Summit where I was able to interact with my audience and received positive feedback. I enjoy meeting and learning from others and I value the different experience that we all bring to projects.

## Operational Requirements

### Willingness to travel

I presently have a Blanket Travel Authority (BTA) signed that allows me to travel to NCR for 1 week every month until Canada.ca is fully integrated into the Above Experience Manager system.

### Willingness to work overtime

I am willing to work overtime whenever needed.

I look forward to taking the exam and meeting with you to discuss how I would be a great fit in your team of experts.

Thank you,
